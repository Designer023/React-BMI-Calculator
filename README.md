# A basic react BMI calculator


## What does the app do?

The app is a basic BMI calculator and table that takes a user's input data and generates a table of BMI values to visualise the user's BMI position on a chart.

I created this app to help me understand how best to organise ReactJS components and learn how to use Redux.

## What are the inputs
- Takes a height and weight and generates the BMI.
- Can take a metric height in CM or an Imperial height in Feet & Inches.
- Can take a metric weight in KG or imperial weight in Lbs.

## Roadmap

### Design

- Add Sass for styles
- Style the table with better colours
- Style the inputs
- Add more user friendly increment/decrement buttons
- Nicer toggles

### Programming

- Add required & default props
- Unit tests
- Comments and documentation


## About the app

Base setup is from the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and then Redux has been added for data flow/control. The redux was setup by following the [React 101 using redux tutorial](https://blog.tighten.co/react-101-using-redux) by Tighten Co.
